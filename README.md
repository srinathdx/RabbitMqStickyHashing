# RabbitMqStickyHashing
This repository demonstrates sticky routing with consistent hashing in RabbitMQ, ensuring that: - Messages with the same hash key are consistently routed to the same queue. - Consumers run only on specific nodes, despite sharing the same codebase. - Environment-based configurations dynamically adjust between local and clustered setups.

ðŸ”§ Features
âœ… Consistent Hashing Exchange for sticky routing
âœ… Dynamic Consumer Node Affinity using environment variables (NODE_ID)
âœ… Spring Boot Auto-Configuration for queue and node bindings
âœ… Supports Localhost & Clustered Deployments
âœ… RabbitMQ Management UI & CLI Integration
